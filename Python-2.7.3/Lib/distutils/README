This directory contains the Distutils package.

There's a full documentation available at:

    http://docs.python.org/distutils/

The Distutils-SIG web page is also a good starting point:

WARNING : Distutils must remain compatible with 2.3
NOTE: After "Revision 77704 : taking sysconfig out of distutils"
Distutils package is not compatible with versions before 2.7a3.
Although "Revision 77759 : reintroduced the names in Distutils for APIs
that were relocated"(i.e. API is backward compatibile) to cross compile
python on build system has to be at least version 2.7a3.
